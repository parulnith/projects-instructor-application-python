    "Stock markets play an important part in the economy of a country. The government, industry and the central banks keep a close eye on the fluctuations of the stock prices since there is a lot to gain and lose from it. Predicting stock prices is a very difficult thing to achieve due to the volatile nature of the industry. However, Machine learning has proved to be of immense help when predicting stock prices. Not only does Machine Learning make the whole process simpler, but it also helps to provide near accurate results for the same. \n",
    "In this project, you will use machine learning techniques to predict and analyze the stock prices of the e-commerce giant **Amazon**.\n",

    "Some recommended prerequisites for this project are:\n",
    "* [Supervised Learning with scikit-learn](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/supervised-learning-with-scikit-learn)\n",
    "* [pandas Foundations](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/pandas-foundations)\n",

    "The stock data has been taken from [Quandl](https://www.quandl.com/), a company that offers a python API to grab data from a number of sources. Quandl sources data from over 500 publishers and has options for free and paid data sources. The data used is in this project is free and has been extracted and converted to aÂ .csv file."
